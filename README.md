UNIT SONIC I2C is an I2C interface ultrasonic distance sensor. This allows for easy I2C integration and multi-sensor operation using a single BUS, to save I/O resources. The module features an RCWL-9620 ultrasonic distance measurement chip with a 16mm probe, which the ranging accuracy can reach 2cm-450cm(accuracy up to Â±2%). It is ideal to apply in robotics obstacle avoidance, fluid level detection, and other applications that require you to perform measurements.
